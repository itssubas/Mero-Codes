### Introduction

This is a kind of hobby project that I've done while I was learning C programming language for the first time in first semseter of my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering.

***

It was developed in **Turbo C++** IDE platform so there may arise some problem while running  in Codeblocks or other IDEs
*[Problem was because of header file issue on unix systems]*

### Methods

    center(char str[80],int row)
    
This function aligns the String passed as an argument in the Center.

    mybox(int type,int start,int len,int wid)
    
This draws box like structure

    myline(int type,int start,int len)
    
This prints string like a straight line.
